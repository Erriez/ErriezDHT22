/*!
 * \brief DHT22 sensor class
 * \details
 *      According to the datasheet, the AM2302/AM2303 is a low cost consumer temperature sensor. It
 *      may not be used in safety critical applications, emergency stop devices or any other
 *      occasion that failure of AM2302/AM2303 may cause personal injury.
 *
 *      The AM2302/AM2303 is factory calibrated. However, deviation may occur with aging.
 *
 *      The temperature/humidity read interval in this library is cached for 2 seconds to prevent
 *      heating-up the internal chip with continues reading.
 *
 *      Global interrupts are disabled during a synchronous sensor read transfer. This is required
 *      to sample the data bit lengths at maximum speed on low-end devices without any application
 *      interrupts. The read calls are protected with a timeout.
 *
 *      The application is responsible for checking ~0 values after a read which means that the
 *      read failed or a timeout occurred. Multiple reads by the application with an average
 *      calculation is recommended.
